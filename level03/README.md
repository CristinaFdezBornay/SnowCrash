# LEVEL 03

## üí° Explanation

In this level we have to:
1. When running the file level03 we get 'Exploit me'.
2. We check the permissions of the file level03: `ls -la level03` => `-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag03  level03 8.5K Mar  5  2016 level03`:
    - The file's owner is the user 'flag03' (permissions `rws` => read, write, and setuid : execute as the user).
    - The file's group is 'level03' (permissions `r-s` => read, and setgid : execute as the group).
3. We see that it executes `/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me`.
4. We modify the command `echo` to make it run `getflag` with the flag03 user permissions.
5. Last but not least, we just have permissions to create a file in /tmp so we have to do it there.
